Hi gudevening, it me francis and welcome to my daily productive evening routine

I usually finish my duty around 11 pm in the evening after a 8 to hours of work I usually sleep between 1 to 2 am in the morning each day.

So it means I have I have around  1 to 2 hours of what I called “me time”

And in today’s video I’m gonna walk you through some of the things that I do every night after work

**Voice**

What I mostly do and for me  the most important thing that I do each time I went to my cabin is that I call back home and have a video call with my wife and my kids

[calling home montage]

**A-roll**

Now as you know as an OFW I think the biggest challenges for us is not about the job that we  have but , but being away from you loves ones and family  is the hardest part.

Having a little conversion with my family back home gives me this stress free nights before going to sleep.asides from keeping  me updated on what is happening to them and how they are doing

me video calling with my family back home and some conversations with them

(Search in the internet of benefits of having a constant communication with your family )

**A-roll**

After around to 30-45 minutes conversation with my wife and my kids the next that I do is pull out my laptop and do some writing scripts on my video or do some outlining for my up coming weekly email newsletter.

by the way if you don’t yet you can check my website and sing up for my weekly email newsletter called Monday meetup i will put also in the description below

**Voice**

If I am not writing a scripts or a blog post I am doing some video editing if I have some footage that I need to process

This process will took me around 30 to an hour and depend if am not really tired that day, now there are times that I really procrastinate that I really feel lazy to get started

**A-roll**

And if you are just like me there is one technique that really helps me to beat procrastination

**Voice**

And this technique called a ***2 minute rule***

Every time you procrastinate on something that you know must do

Just tell to yourself “I just going to do it for just 2 minutes” it is a little hack to our brain to start something.

**A-rool**

Because according to Isaac Newton law of Physics is that

“An object is at rest or traveling on a constant velocity unless is acted on an imbalanced active force”

This techniques helps me to do some of my major task for the day, like planning a YouTube content, video editing, and writing scripts reading books most important task that really move the needles

And before you know it, you are doing your tasks more than 2 minutes because you are reaching now what they call it “the flow state”

If I am not writing scripts or editing video on my laptop, I am doing a typing speed practice to improve my typing speed this is what “Ali Abdaal” called “productive procrastination” I am still being productive even I’m am not doing the things that needs to be done

Then on my phone I open one of my favorite app called make time and do my daily highlights for the day,

By the way I got this app and this process  in the book called make time.

The idea is that each day you pick one only task each day called “your daily highlights” and this is the task that you give joy and make your day.

Now it doesn’t have to be the most congilutive tasks it just a tasks that you if you did it for the day it means your day is complete.

**B-roll**

So for my today’s highlights is “reorganized my stuff here at room”

Then at the end of each day there’s is this prompt that let you reflect what you did for the whole day.

**A-roll**

Another app that I used each night is called to do list

So on top of my main highlights for the day, if I need to do something for the day like doing laundry, something to buy, etc. I put it on my to do list

**B-roll**

(List some items)

And as I go to my bed and time to sleep I spend around 10 to 15 to minutes reading books on my kindle

I am trying to aviod using my phone before I go to bed.

**[A-roll]**

What I observed is that I have a better sleep each night and not feeling tired in the morning when I am not using my phone before going to sleep

Now here’s the good things of having a  limited time of  internet on board, yes we do have an internet on board but it cost a lot of money, and that is why we must be intentional on how we use the internet here. and because of that I have less time on phone than ever before.

So those are the things that usually each night after work.

Now it doesn’t mean that if someone ask me to have a  drink on the crew bar i will say no, of course  i will say yes, but if I knew that I needed to do something more important or I needed to finish to edit I will still proiritize that things that  really matters to me.

Having this default things to do makes much more easier for me to plan my day rather than to do a random things each nights

That being said hope you like my today’s video and gives you some inspiration and idea on how to make not just your evening but also your daily routine more productive 

and thank you for watching and see you on my next video bye.
